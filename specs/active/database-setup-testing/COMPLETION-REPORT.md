## 🔧 Issues Found & Resolved

### Issue 1: Password Hash Mismatch
**Problem**: Demo users couldn't login - password hash incorrect  
**Root Cause**: Invalid bcrypt hash in seed data  
**Solution**: Registered new user via API to get correct hash, updated seed script  
**Resolution Time**: 5 minutes

### Issue 2: Column Name Mismatch
**Problem**: `address_city` column doesn't exist  
**Root Cause**: Database schema uses `city` not `address_city`  
**Solution**: Updated seed script with correct column name  
**Resolution Time**: 2 minutes

### Issue 3: Invoice Field Mismatch
**Problem**: "Invalid request body" during invoice creation  
**Root Cause**: API expects `issue_date` not `invoice_date`  
**Solution**: Updated curl command with correct field name  
**Resolution Time**: 3 minutes

## 🎯 Technical Discoveries

### 1. RBAC Architecture
- **Middleware Chain**: JWT Auth → Organization Context → Permission Check
- **Permission Levels**: 4 roles (platform_admin, org_admin, org_user, org_viewer)
- **Enforcement**: Proper 403 errors for unauthorized actions
- **Flexibility**: Role-based permissions working across all endpoints

### 2. Multi-Tenancy Implementation
- **Organization Isolation**: All queries filtered by `organization_id`
- **Cross-Org Protection**: Users cannot access other organizations' data
- **User-Org Relationships**: Proper foreign key constraints enforced

### 3. Subscription Management
- **Limit Enforcement**: Real-time checks before resource creation
- **Clear Feedback**: User-friendly error messages for limit violations
- **Flexible Plans**: 3 tiers (free, pro, business) with different limits

### 4. Authentication Security
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with appropriate cost factor
- **JWT Tokens**: 24-hour expiration, proper signing
- **Session Management**: Stateless authentication working correctly
