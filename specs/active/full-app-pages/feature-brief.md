- Display a list of all clients in a data table (`@tanstack/react-table`).
- Columns: Client Name, Email, Company, Phone.
- Actions: Add, Edit, View, Delete.
- Functionality: Search and filter clients.

**Invoice Page (`/dashboard/invoices`)**:
- Display a list of all invoices in a data table.
- Columns: Invoice #, Client Name, Issue Date, Due Date, Total Amount, Status.
- Actions: Add, Edit, View, Delete, Send, Download PDF.
- Functionality: Search and filter by status.

**Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)**:
- Replace all mock data with live data from API endpoints.
- Stats Cards: Total Revenue, New Customers, Active Invoices.
- Recent Invoices: Display a table of the 5 most recent invoices.

**Settings Page (`/dashboard/settings`)**:
- A tabbed interface with placeholder sections for Profile, Organization, Notifications, and Security.

**Invoice Detail Page (`/dashboard/invoices/$invoiceId`)**:
- Full invoice view with line items, client information, and status management.
- Actions: Send, Download PDF, Mark as Paid, Delete.
- Real-time status updates with optimistic UI.

**Client Detail Page (`/dashboard/clients/$clientId`)**:
- Client profile with contact information and financial summary.
- Associated invoices list with links to detail views.
- Actions: Edit, Delete with confirmation.

- Stats: Total received, pending payments, success rate.

**Analytics Page (`/dashboard/analytics`)**:
- Business insights with live API data.
- Revenue trends, invoice status distribution, client growth.
- Key metrics: Average invoice value, monthly performance, payment rates.

### 3. Architecture & Implementation Plan

- **Routing**: Utilize the existing TanStack Router setup. Create new routes for `/clients`, `/invoices`, and `/settings` as children of the `/dashboard` layout.
- **Data Fetching**: Use TanStack Query (`useQuery`) for fetching data for tables and the dashboard.
- **Data Mutation**: Use TanStack Query (`useMutation`) for all create, update, and delete operations, with proper cache invalidation to ensure UI updates.
- **Component Library**: Continue using `shadcn/ui` for all UI elements, including `Table`, `Dialog` (for forms), `Card`, `Button`, `Input`, etc.
- **Forms**: Use React Hook Form with Zod for validation on all client and invoice forms.
- **State Management**: Rely on TanStack Query for server state. No complex client-side state management is anticipated.
- **API Client**: Use the existing Axios instance in `src/lib/api.ts`.

### 9. Performance Optimization Details

**Code Splitting Implementation**:
- **Manual Chunking**: Configured Vite with strategic chunk splitting:
  - Vendor chunks: React, Router, UI libraries, Form libraries, Table libraries, Chart libraries
  - Feature chunks: Dashboard, Invoices, Clients, Analytics, Payments, Settings
  - Component chunks: Invoice components, Client components, UI components
- **Lazy Loading**: All page components use React.lazy() with dynamic imports
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Added loading fallbacks for smooth user experience
- **Bundle Analysis**: Reduced main bundle from 1.16MB to 187KB (84% reduction)

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Before**: Single 1.16MB bundle (335KB gzipped) with chunk size warnings
- **After**: 20 optimized chunks with largest at 392KB (107KB gzipped)
- **Main Bundle**: 187KB (59KB gzipped) - 84% reduction
- **Initial Load**: Faster due to smaller main bundle and lazy loading
- **Caching**: Better browser caching with vendor chunks separated

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Vite Config**: Added `rollupOptions.output.manualChunks` configuration
- **Router**: Converted all page imports to React.lazy() with proper TypeScript typing
- **Loading Component**: Created reusable Loading component with size variants
- **Suspense**: Added Suspense boundaries around lazy-loaded components

### Research & Notes
- Backend exposes `/api/invoices` CRUD endpoints plus status updates; invoices require client associations and include items.
- Backend exposes `/api/clients` CRUD endpoints; all fields except name and email are optional.
- Zod schema (`invoiceSchema`) needs expanding to cover currency, status, totals, and items; existing schema misses required backend fields.
- Client search is client-side; for large datasets, consider server-side search with debouncing.
- Payment processing requires backend implementation; frontend provides comprehensive integration roadmap.
- Analytics page provides real-time business insights using existing API data with calculated metrics.
- Code splitting significantly improves initial load performance and enables better caching strategies.
- Manual chunking provides fine-grained control over bundle optimization and loading performance.
