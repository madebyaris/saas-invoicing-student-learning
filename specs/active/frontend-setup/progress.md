## Technical Achievements

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React 19 RC with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.1.9 with hot reload
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom variants
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui with dashboard-01 and login-03 blocks
- **Routing**: TanStack Router v1 (code-based)
- **State**: TanStack Query v5 for server state
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **HTTP**: Axios with JWT interceptors

### Docker Integration
- **Development**: Hot reload with pnpm + Vite in node:20-alpine
- **Production**: Multi-stage build with nginx:alpine
- **Networking**: Proper CORS and API URL configuration
- **Optimization**: Gzip compression, caching, security headers

### Authentication Flow
- **Login**: POST /api/auth/login with email/password
- **Token Storage**: localStorage with JWT
- **Auto-Refresh**: 401 interceptor redirects to /login
- **Protected Routes**: ProtectedLayout enforces authentication
- **Test User**: admin@invoicing.com / password123

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Tailwind CSS v4 Production Build
**Problem**: `@apply border-border` utilities failed in production build  
**Solution**: Replaced with direct CSS variables:
```css
border-color: hsl(var(--border));
outline-color: hsl(var(--ring));
```

### 2. Nginx Configuration
**Problem**: Invalid `must-revalidate` token in gzip_proxied  
**Solution**: Removed unsupported token, kept valid options:
```nginx
gzip_proxied expired no-cache no-store private auth;
```

### 3. API URL Configuration
**Problem**: Frontend using `host.docker.internal:8080` from browser  
**Solution**: Changed to `localhost:8080` (browser perspective):
```yaml
environment:
  - VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### 4. CORS Configuration
**Problem**: Backend not accepting frontend origin  
**Solution**: Already configured correctly in Go backend:
```go
AllowOrigins: []string{
  "http://localhost:3000",
  "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
}
```

## Testing Results

### ✅ Local Development
```bash
cd invoicing-frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# → http://localhost:5173 (works)
```

### ✅ Local Production Build
```bash
cd invoicing-frontend
pnpm build
# → dist/ created successfully
```

### ✅ Docker Development
```bash
docker compose --profile dev up
# → http://localhost:3000 (works)
# → Hot reload functional
# → API calls to localhost:8080 succeed
```

### ✅ Docker Production
```bash
docker build -t invoicing-frontend-prod invoicing-frontend/
docker run -d -p 8081:80 invoicing-frontend-prod
# → Container starts successfully
# → Nginx serves static files
```

### ✅ Authentication Flow
```bash
# 1. Register test user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register \
  -d '{"email":"admin@invoicing.com","password":"password123","first_name":"Admin","last_name":"User"}'
# → Success: User created with JWT token

# 2. Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -d '{"email":"admin@invoicing.com","password":"password123"}'
# → Success: JWT token returned

# 3. Frontend login
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login
# Enter: admin@invoicing.com / password123
# → Success: Redirects to /dashboard
# → JWT stored in localStorage
```

### Quick Start Guide

**Development:**
```bash
# Start full stack
docker compose --profile dev up

# Access services
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend:  http://localhost:8080
pgAdmin:  http://localhost:5050

# Test credentials
Email:    admin@invoicing.com
Password: password123
```

**Production:**
```bash
# Build production image
docker build -t invoicing-frontend-prod invoicing-frontend/

# Run production container
docker run -d -p 80:80 invoicing-frontend-prod

# Or use docker-compose.prod.yml
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Environment Variables
- `VITE_API_URL` - Backend API URL (default: http://localhost:8080)
- `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING` - Enable hot reload in Docker (true)

### Port Mapping
- **Development**: 3000 (host) → 5173 (container, Vite)
- **Production**: 80 (host) → 80 (container, nginx)
- **Backend**: 8080 (host) → 8080 (container)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Tailwind CSS v4 Changes
Tailwind v4 doesn't support `@apply` with custom utility classes like `border-border`. Use direct CSS variables instead.

### 2. Docker Networking
When frontend runs in a container but browser accesses from host, API URL must be from browser's perspective (`localhost:8080`), not container's perspective (`host.docker.internal:8080`).

### 3. Nginx Configuration
Nginx `gzip_proxied` directive has specific valid tokens. Invalid tokens like `must-revalidate` cause startup failures. Always validate nginx config syntax.

### 4. shadcn/ui Blocks
Some shadcn blocks reference components that aren't automatically created. May need to manually create missing components like `oauth-button` and `icons`.

### 5. React 19 RC
React 19 is still in RC but stable enough for development. TanStack libraries have excellent React 19 support.

## Conclusion

The frontend setup is **fully complete and production-ready**. All core functionality works:
- ✅ Authentication flow (login, logout, token management)
- ✅ Protected routes with auth guards
- ✅ API integration with JWT interceptors
- ✅ Docker development with hot reload
- ✅ Docker production with optimized build
- ✅ Modern UI with shadcn/ui components
- ✅ TypeScript type safety throughout
- ✅ Form validation with Zod schemas

The system is ready for implementing business features (clients, invoices, dashboard metrics).
